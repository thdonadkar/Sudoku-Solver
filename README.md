# Sudoku_solver
Python program that solves sudoku boards using a backtracking algorithm through recursion.

Sudoku.py is the code for solving sudoku boards. The solved sudoku board will be printed on the Terminal.

GUI.py uses pygame to create a GUI and to visualize how the sudoku board is being solved through backtracking.
When the GUI is running, press BACKSPACE and the GUI will solve the board in real time and show the backtracking aspect of the algorithm.
*pygame required
